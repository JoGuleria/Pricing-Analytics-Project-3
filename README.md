Project Context:
As part of my coursework in Pricing Analytics at Simon Business School, I worked on a simulated consumer choice dataset modeled after the FMCG beverage industry. The dataset captured individual-level purchase decisions for three products — two from the same brand (Kiwi Bubbles and Kiwi Regular) and one from a competing brand (Mango Bubbles) — along with associated price information.

The goal was to apply advanced econometric techniques to estimate demand, evaluate price sensitivity, and uncover latent consumer segments based on behavior, not demographics. Using latent class multinomial logit modeling in R, I explored how subtle shifts in price impact brand choice — and how hidden segments can dramatically influence strategy.
